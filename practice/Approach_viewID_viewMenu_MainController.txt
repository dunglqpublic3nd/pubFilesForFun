This document describes how to implement new approach to Managing view on the go
 
Actors / participants
    MainController, FunctionControllers (ex: DashboardController, UpdateController), ViewManagerController, CommnunicationChannel, ErrorController
    
Roles description:
    ViewManagerController
        provide mechanism to manage view, viewId
    
    ErrorController
        a specialized controller to display error and display all view navigation option in its menu
            or could be a subject for future changes

    FunctionControllers
        keeps track of model to each view it generated
        generate view, view menu
    
    MainController
        provides an entry to application
        runs application in harmony by combining ViewManagerController and other FunctionControllers.
        provides place holder to display view content and view menu
    
    CommunicationChannel 
        should also provide a mechanism to return the message has been sent. If there is no receipent to deliver the message.
    
Implementation detail
    CommunicationChannel 
        Changes
            onMessageArrive
                implementor should return true or false
                    true the message is handled
                    false the message is not handled and as subject to be returned to sender. If there is no receipent can handle the message.
            the deliver method should include the sender as parameter incase there is no receipent can handle the message. Sender must implement must implement a new Method onMessageReturned
                onMessageReturned(topic, message)
    MainController
        changes
            draft1: 
                request / listen to ViewsContextChange
                answer to Start (self call) or Show View
                    request ViewsContext
                Show view without id
                    request view creating 
                    request view menu items
                    SHOWING error view if any error is generated
                Show view with id
                    retrieving generated view
                    inform FunctionController
                        in case of updating view, replace it with a new one
                    requesting view menu items.
                    SHOWING error view if any error is generated
                Showing error view
                synthesizing View Menu Item
                    The controller should provide a mechanism to declare View Menus instruction
                        pseudo implementation:
                            {
                                ViewManager: {

                                Dashboard{

                                PracticeTypes{

                                Composer{
                                    AllowLinkToOtherFunctions: true,

                                },
                                KanjiCollector{

                                }
                            }

                    
    FunctionControllers
        provide mechanism to creates view.
        provide mechanism to generate menu.
        provide mechanism to discuss model.
        provide a view id that identifies view
